## Advanced Statistical Models in Psychology

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of advanced statistical models applied to psychological test data, focusing on Item Response Theory (IRT), Latent Class Analysis (LCA), and Bayesian modeling techniques. The goal is to analyze test items, uncover latent traits influencing test responses, identify respondent classes, and refine psychological assessments for accuracy and reliability.

 ## Prerequisites

The analysis is conducted using R. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. You can download them from:

- R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- RStudio: [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


## Running the Analysis

Open the R script in RStudio and run it to perform the analysis. Ensure you have set the working directory to the folder containing the script or use `setwd()` to set it programmatically.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of 500 responses to a 10-item psychological test, with responses coded as 0 (incorrect/no) or 1 (correct/yes). This simulated data is used for demonstrating statistical modeling techniques.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the psychometric properties of the test items, identifies various respondent classes, and evaluates the effectiveness of test items through IRT, LCA, and Bayesian models.
